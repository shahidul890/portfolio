        <p class="lead">Every business is different. Sometimes, a simple website or a ready-made CMS like WordPress is not enough. As digital technologies continue to evolve, businesses are expected to do more than just "have a website." They need tools that can streamline operations, improve customer experiences, and adapt to their unique goals. This is where a <strong>custom web application</strong> can help.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">What Is a Custom Web Application?</h2>
        <p class="lead">A custom web application is software built specifically for your business. It runs in a web browser and is
            designed to meet your exact needs. Unlike ready-made tools, a custom app is made from scratch using coding
            languages like <strong>PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, React, or Vue</strong>. It gives you full control over how
            it works and looks.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">How Is It Different from a Website or CMS?</h2>
        <div class="table-responsive">
            <table class="table table-dark table-bordered table-striped">
                <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Feature</th>
                    <th>Website / CMS</th>
                    <th>Custom Web Application</th>
                </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Purpose</td>
                    <td>Content-focused</td>
                    <td>Business functionality & workflows</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Flexibility</td>
                    <td>Limited</td>
                    <td>Fully customizable</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Security</td>
                    <td>Risk from third-party plugins</td>
                    <td>Tailored, business-specific security</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Performance</td>
                    <td>May depend on plugins</td>
                    <td>Optimized and fast</td>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Why a Ready-Made CMS Is Not Always Enough</h2>
        <p class="lead">Popular CMS platforms like WordPress, Shopify, or Wix are great for simple websites. But they have limits.</p>
        <p>Here’s why they may not work for every business:</p>
        <ul class="lead">
            <li>You have to adjust your business to fit how the CMS works</li>
            <li>You may depend on plugins that can slow down the site</li>
            <li>CMS platforms often have security risks</li>
            <li>Custom features may not be easy to add</li>
            <li>They’re not ideal for high traffic or unique user flows</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">CMS tools are great for simple websites. But if your business has special needs, a <strong>custom web app is
                the better choice</strong>.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">When Does a Business Need a Custom Web Application?</h2>

            <li>You want to offer a unique user experience</li>
            <li>You need to connect other systems (like CRMs or APIs)</li>
            <li>You want to scale and need flexibility</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Benefits of a Custom Web Application</h2>

            <li>Easy to improve over time</li>

            <li>More secure and private</li>
            <li>Can connect with any tool you use</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Examples of Custom Web Apps</h2>
