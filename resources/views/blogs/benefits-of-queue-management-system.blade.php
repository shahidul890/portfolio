                    <p>
                        A Queue Management System (QMS) is a solution used to manage customer flow and service processes efficiently in environments like banks, hospitals, and government offices. It helps organize waiting lines, either virtually or physically, by assigning tokens or numbers to customers and directing them to available service counters. The system reduces wait times, enhances customer experience, and improves staff productivity by streamlining service delivery. Modern QMS often includes digital displays, self-service kiosks, and mobile integration for real-time updates. By minimizing congestion and confusion, it ensures a fair and orderly customer service process, improving overall satisfaction and operational efficiency.
