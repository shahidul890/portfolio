                <h5 class="section-title">What is SEO and Why Does It Matter?</h5>
                <p>SEO is the process of optimizing your website so it ranks higher on search engines like Google. When your site appears on the first page of search results, you get more organic traffic, qualified leads, and increased brand credibility. Here’s why SEO is important for any website:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong> <u>Increases Visibility and Traffic:</u> </strong>
                        <p>When your site ranks higher on Google, more users are likely to visit. The first page of search results gets over 90% of clicks, while the second page gets less than 5%. Without SEO, your website might be invisible to your target audience.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> <u>Builds Credibility and Trust:</u> </strong>
                        <p>Users trust search engines. If your website appears on top results, it signals authority and reliability. With optimized content, quality backlinks, and a fast-loading website, you create a strong first impression.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> <u>Improves User Experience (UX):</u> </strong>
                        <p>SEO isn't just about keywords; it's also about how your website performs. A mobile-friendly layout, fast loading time, and easy navigation all contribute to better rankings and a better experience for your visitors.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> <u>Cost-Effective Marketing:</u> </strong>
                        <p>Compared to paid advertising, SEO provides long-term value. Once your website ranks well, you can enjoy consistent traffic without continuously spending on ads.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> <u>Boosts Conversion Rates</u> </strong>
                        <p>SEO brings in targeted traffic—people actively searching for what you offer. With proper optimization, these visitors are more likely to convert into customers or subscribers.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
